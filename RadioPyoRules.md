## Rules to follow if you want to have your script played on Radio Pyo ##


  * It must be a one-page script, named as _author`_`title.py_
  * The server's variable must be _s_
  * The script must be finite in time, with fade-in and fade-out to avoid clicks between pieces. There must be a "duration" variable in the script. Example: for a 5 minutes piece, duration is specified in seconds with this line : _duration = 300_
  * No soundfile, only synthesis!
  * To submit your script, send it to belangeo@gmail.com or jm.dumas@gmail.com
